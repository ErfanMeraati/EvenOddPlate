# Traffic Zone Eligibility Checker  

## About the Project  
This is a **simple web-based tool** that determines whether a vehicle is allowed to enter the **even-odd traffic zone** based on its license plate number and the current day's parity.  

Users enter their **license plate number**, and the system checks if they can legally drive in the restricted traffic zone on that day. The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

## Features  
- Determines access to the **even-odd traffic zone** based on the last digit of the plate number  
- Simple and fast user interface  
- No server required, runs entirely in the browser
